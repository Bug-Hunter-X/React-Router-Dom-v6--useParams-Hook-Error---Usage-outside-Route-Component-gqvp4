In React Router Dom v6, attempting to use the `useParams()` hook outside of a component rendered within a `<Route>` element will result in an error.  The `useParams()` hook relies on the routing context provided by the React Router, which is only available within route components.  This often leads to unexpected behavior or runtime errors if not handled properly.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage:
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const { id } = useParams(); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
  return <div>My Component</div>;
}
```
